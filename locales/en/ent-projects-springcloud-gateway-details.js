  MICROSERVICEGATEWAYS_REPLICA_DESC:
    'Deployment is used to describe a desired state that is expected to be reached by the application. It is mainly used to describe stateless applications. The number and state of replicas are maintained by the deployment controller, ensuring the state is consistent with the defined expected state. You can increase the replicas to meet higher loads. Rolling back the deployment version can eliminate program bugs. And you can create an autoscaler to flexibly handle the load in different scenarios.',
