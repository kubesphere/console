  SERVICE_DESC:
    'A Service is an abstraction that defines a logical collection of Pods and a strategy for accessing them.',
  SERVICE_CREATE_DESC:
    'A Service is an abstraction that defines a logical collection of Pods and a strategy for accessing them. You can select the Service type or how a Service is created. KubeSphere supports both stateful and stateless Services and Services can be created through codes or artifacts.',

  SERVICES_BASEINFO_DESC:
    'The name and description of the service need to be provided to create the service. The service name cannot be the same as the existing service name under the same project.',

    'The cluster will not create an IP for the service. Instead, clients within the cluster access it through its endpoints directly. For example, services that need to distinguish master from slave.',

  SCENARIOS_FOR_SERVICES_A:
    'Stateless Services are useful for scenarios where persistent data is not stored locally and multiple instances respond to uniform requests (Nginx, Tomcat, etc.). Stateful Services are helpful when it comes to data storage, multithreading or queues (MySQL database, Kafka, Zookeeper, etc.).',

    'Stateful services are used to manage stateful applications, ensuring ordered and graceful deployment and scaling. They also provide stable persistent storage and network identifiers.',

    'The most commonly used service in container services. It defines the Pod template to control the Pod status, including rolling updates and rollbacks.',
